# Flashcard-Generator

This is a simple nodejs flashcard tool that takes in user input using the inquirer npm package, and uses constructors to create flashcards that can be used for study. To use, clone the repository, run npm install in your terminal, and then run node server.js to start the prompts. It's currently preloaded with several random questions.
